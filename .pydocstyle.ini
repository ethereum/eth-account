; Explanation:
; D400 - Enabling this error code seems to make it a requirement that the first
; sentence in a docstring is not split across two lines.  It also makes it a
; requirement that no docstring can have a multi-sentence description without a
; summary line.  Neither one of those requirements seem appropriate.
